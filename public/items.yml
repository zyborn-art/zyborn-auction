    Bitcoin as Survival Rations: One Million Dollars Sealed in a Can.
    

    In an era defined by military conflict, financial uncertainty, and rapid digital transformation, ZYBORN seals one million dollars' worth of Bitcoin into tin cans and releases them as artworks at auction.
    

    The project poses a fundamental question: as money becomes increasingly abstract, what can truly be considered a survival resource today?
